## Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to utilize publicly available Formula 1 racing data to understand key performance metrics of drivers and teams. The project aims to provide insights into factors that influence race outcomes, helping fans and analysts to better appreciate the intricacies of the sport.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle's Formula 1 World Championship dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). This dataset contains historical race results, driver information, constructor data, and more.

## Report Summary

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Formula 1 racing data. It includes data cleaning, processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover trends and insights regarding driver and team performance. The analysis aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to success in Formula 1 racing.

## Introduction & Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide fans, analysts, and stakeholders in the Formula 1 community with valuable insights into the performance dynamics of the sport. By understanding these factors, stakeholders can make informed decisions, and fans can enhance their appreciation of the sport.

## Importing Files and Libraries

The project uses various Python libraries, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

These libraries are essential for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Cleaning and Processing

Data cleaning and processing involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis and modeling.

## EDA/Visualizations

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to visualize and understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Key questions addressed include:
- Which drivers have the most race wins?
- How have different constructors performed over the years?
- What are the common attributes of top-performing drivers?

## Tableau Dashboard

To further explore the findings and insights from the analysis, an interactive Tableau dashboard has been created. You can view and interact with the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saachi.dholakia/viz/Formula1_17181298051540/Story1).

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals trends and factors that contribute to successful performance in Formula 1 racing. These insights can guide teams and drivers in optimizing their strategies and help fans better understand the competitive landscape.

## Challenges/Limitations

- The dataset may have missing or inconsistent values that can affect the analysis.
- The analysis is limited to the features available in the dataset and may not account for all factors influencing race outcomes.
- External factors (e.g., weather conditions, regulatory changes) are not comprehensively addressed.

## Next Steps

Future work can include:
- Incorporating additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
- Developing predictive models to forecast race outcomes.
- Analyzing the impact of new regulations on team and driver performance.
